## Recommendation System

### 1. Mobility Analytics
Methodology is as listed below
1. 1 geohash -> 1 route-part -> 1 route -> 1 count
2. Make sure user is moving based on sequential points detected along sequential route nodes detected.
3. Make sure its on the desired road.
5. Timeseries analysis.
6. kepler.gl

### 2. Content Based Filtering (Euclidean Distance)
Python notebook with attached dataset

### 3. Collaborative Filtering (Cosine Similiary and Jaccard Similarity)
Python notebook with attached dataset

## Geohash Processing
Python notebook.
Datasets are from geofarbrik and GADM.
Data manipulation and preprocessing of shapefiles are done using geopandas.
